# Planning Document - PSP2025 Project

## Project Overview
Personal Software Process (PSP) implementation for software engineering course.

## Project Structure
- **design/**: Design documents, diagrams, and architecture specifications
- **code/**: Source code implementation
- **test/**: Test cases, scripts, and QA documentation
- **pm/**: Project management, planning, tracking, and metrics
- **planning/**: Planning documents and project roadmap

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Planning and Design

- [ ] User interface implementation
- [ ] Database integration
- [ ] API development
- [ ] Code review and refactoring

### Phase 3: Testing
- [ ] Unit testing
- [ ] Integration testing
- [ ] System testing
- [ ] User acceptance testing
- [ ] Performance testing

### Phase 4: Deployment and Maintenance
- [ ] Production deployment
- [ ] Documentation completion
